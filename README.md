# envimatFrame
Is a merge of the `envimaR` Helpers for setting up working environments which focus on using the same 
initialization parameters across different computers and team members of the environmental informatics working group Marburg. 

It integrates the slightly modified `tinyProject` package by Francois Guillem (guillem.francois@gmail.com).  Basically, it is intended to evaluate the functionality and what is the best praxis of integration. The `tinyProject`is a great lean and flat organised project tool for data analysis while the former `envimaR` package provides deeper and more specific project structures, more complex working environments and a simpler handling of more diverse data sets. However the ``tinyProject`` supports a consistent mapping of a project workflow.
